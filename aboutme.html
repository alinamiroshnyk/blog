                    <p>
                        <br> I was born in Ukraine in New Year's Eve in 1990 and I
                        <br> Believe since that time I was dreaming to create some magic.
                        <br> I moved to USA in 2014 having a Master's degree in
                        <br> Management and some QA Analyst experience.
                        <br>
                        <br> Attention to details and curious mind helped me being really
                        <br> good at what I was doing. I have more than 4 years of
                        <br> experience in Quality Assurance and currently I’m developing
                        <br> myself as an Automation QA Engineer. I love coding but I love
                        <br> QA too much to move to development.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Combination of those
                        <br> desires makes me a perfect Automation who wants to develop
                        <br> skills and cover all possible routine in testing life cycle.
                        <br> Currently I’m working on automation coverage of SDK,
                        <br> implementing TeamCity as a CI tool for my company <br>
                        and working hard to develop my skills towards front-end <br>development.

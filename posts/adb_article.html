                    <p class="p">Android Debug Bridge (adb) is a versatile command-line tool that lets you communicate
                        with a
                        device. The adb command facilitates a variety of device actions, such as installing and
                        debugging apps, and it provides access to a Unix shell that you can use to run a variety of
                        commands on a device.

                        The following example shows the <b>devices command</b> and its output. There are <i>three
                            devices</i>
                        running.
                        The <u>first two lines</u> in the list are emulators, and the third line is a hardware device
                        that is
                        attached to the computer.

                        The adb devices command has a corner-case command sequence that causes running emulator(s) to
                        not
                        show up in the adb devices output even though the emulator(s) are visible on your desktop. This
                        happens when all of the following conditions are true:

                        The adb server is not running, and
                        You use the emulator command with the -port or -ports option with an odd-numbered port value
                        between 5554 and 5584, and
                        The odd-numbered port you chose is not busy so the port connection can be made at the specified
                        port number, or if it is busy, the emulator switches to another port that meets the requirements
                        in 2, and
                        You start the adb server after you start the emulator.
                        One way to avoid this situation is to let the emulator choose its own ports, and don't run more
                        than 16 emulators at once. Another way is to always start the adb server before you use the
                        emulator command, as explained in the following examples.</p>

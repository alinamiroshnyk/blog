## Tech blog
I came up with an idea of creating a technical blog for explaining complicated things in an easy way.
So far the website itself is ready but I need to write actual article so it's more than "lorem ipsum dolor" placeholder.

## Why did I do this?
I'm enjoying coding and improving my skills and some things I considered very complicated before currently are not that scary.
So I decided to create a blog explaining some scary things so people would more likely continue their development education and don't stuck on some topic.
I'm planning to write in this blog about automation testing, CI and other things.
